This React app is a minimum reproducible example for a problem testing React Apollo mutations via MockedProvider.

The app displays a pet type (initially 'Cat') on the screen. Pressing a button changes 'Cat' to 'Dog'.

`yarn start` to run the app locally, but the graphql mutation (the dog-ify button) won't work because no backend.

`yarn test` to run the tests and see one fail.
